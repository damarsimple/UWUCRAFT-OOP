                    CODING MY OWN JAVA PLUGINS (HELP)

Plugins Used :
                    MysqlInventoryBridge,
                    PlayerSync,
                    SkinsRestorer,
                    WorldEdit,
                    SuperTrails,
                    StatsAPI,
                    WebSender,
                    PlayerStats,
                    AdvancedBan,
                    Vault,
                    MysqlExperienceBridge,
                    MysqlEcoBridge,
                    Essentials,
                    AuthMe

Minus :

                          Cant buy if players not online / onserver
                          Mysql economy plugins has to be 0.1 for accurate update Has to checked database first for buy functions for every purchase
                          tables has to be spesific because different plugins use different tables name and UUID names
                          More to add
