# Idea

Using REACT PHP i can create websocket API that can be used for chats users notification and Live Data Update

## Implementation

i hope i can use this to pass Event that happening in the game to ReactPHP websocket for example player Death Event

Using Websocket i think i can achieve 100% accurate data

Notification System Using React Toastify

- $Player1 place a bounty on you
- $Player1 requested you to be friend
- $Player1 requested you to join your guild
- $Player1 bid your $Item Diamond_Sword for $1000

Feature for uwucraft plugin
Post To ReactPHP websocket using Redis database

- $Player1 has been Killed by $Player2 Using $Player2.getItemInHand()
- $Player1 has just Won The Match
- $Player1 Whisper to $Player2 post to socket

and many more !
